# Dannys--dinner
This project is derived from Danny Ma's #8WeekSQLChallenge.

# Introduction
Danny Ma, a lover of Japanese food, took a daring step in early 2021 by opening a charming restaurant called Danny's Diner.
The menu primarily features his top three favorite dishes: 
1) Sushi 
2) Surry
3) Ramen 

# Problem Statement
The restaurant is facing challenges and requires assistance in utilizing their collected data to improve their operations. Danny wants to understand customer behavior, expenditure, and preferences to enhance their experience. 
By analyzing this data, he aims to make informed decisions on expanding the customer loyalty program. Additionally, he needs simplified datasets for easy data inspection. Privacy concerns have led to the provision of a sample of customer data for the case study, which should be sufficient to develop functional SQL queries. 
Three key datasets are provided: 
1) Sales
2) Menu
3) Members

# Entity Relationship Diagram
Please find below an entity relationship diagram (ERD) that illustrates the relationships between various entities.

# Case study Questions
1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?
6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?
